# ml-cheat-sheet

This is my attempt at collecting some basic methods and functions for basic machine learning.
My hope is that this will be a quick resource to reference for recepies using sklearn and PyTorch.

Feel free to reach out with suggestions or add an issue/feature request or contribute.

This guide was made using reference to:
[SKlearn recepies](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html), [Kaggle Learn](https://www.kaggle.com/learn), [Hundred Page Machine Learning Book](http://themlbook.com)
